# Getting started

Welcome to Fondue, the design system for the [Frontify](https://frontify.com) ecosystem.

## Installation

Add the Fondue design system package as a dependency to your project.

```shell
npm i @frontify/fondue
# or
pnpm i @frontify/fondue
# or
yarn add @frontify/fondue
```

## Finding components

You can browse all available components in the Storybook instance of the [Fondue design system](https://fondue-components.frontify.com).
This Storybook contains all components from all subpackages in the Fondue monorepo. Each component will have a badge in the top bar indicating its current lifecycle state.

For the designers, the documentation is available in the [Fondue design system documentation](https://weare.frontify.com/document/1266?#/using-fondue) on weare.

## Usage

During the transition period in which we are cleaning up the Fondue components, you can use old and new components side by side.

### Was this component already refactored?

If a component was refactored, the old implementation will be marked as **deprecated**.

This will be visible in the code when you consume the component and through a badge in the top bar of the Storybook story.

### Using refactored components

If you want to use a refactored component, you can already import them through the `/components` subexport in the fondue package.

```tsx
import { Button } from '@frontify/fondue/components';

const App = () => <Button>Click Me</Button>;
```

### Using old components

If you are using the old components, you can continue to import them directly from the `@frontify/fondue` package.

```tsx
import { Button } from '@frontify/fondue';

const App = () => <Button>Click Me</Button>;
```

### Styles

#### Tokens / Themes [new in `v12.4`]
We utilize a theme provider to provide the correct tokens to the components.

To use the provider, you need to import the theme styles and wrap your application in the `ThemeProvider` component.
The `ThemeProvider` will provide the correct tokens to the components based on the theme you provide. The currently available themes are `light` and `dark`.
```tsx
import "@frontify/fondue/tokens/themes";
import { ThemeProvider } "@frontify/fondue/components";

const App = () => (
    <ThemeProvider theme="light">
        ...YourApp
    </ThemeProvider>
);
```

#### Component Styles
The component styles are imported separately from the component itself. This allows you to import the styles only once in your application, instead of importing them with every usage.

```tsx
// chart styles
import '@frontify/fondue/charts/styles';

// component styles
import '@frontify/fondue/components/styles';

// legacy component styles
import '@frontify/fondue/styles';
```

Usages of `ThemeProvider` can be nested to specify a theme for a specific set of components, the closest provider will be used.

```tsx
<ThemeProvider theme="light">
    <ComponentUsingLightTheme />
    <ThemeProvider theme="dark">
        <ComponentUsingDarkTheme />
    </ThemeProvider>
</ThemeProvider>
```
